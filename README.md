## Application Overview

This project is an **Emotional AI LLM Web Application**. It integrates multiple components to provide an interactive experience:

1.  **Python LLM Backend (`emotional_ai_llm_web/app.py`):** This is the core intelligence of the application. It likely uses a Large Language Model (LLM) along with audio and vision encoders to process and understand emotional cues. It runs on `http://localhost:5000`.
2.  **Node.js API Backend (`api/index.js`):** This acts as an intermediary layer, providing an API for the frontend to communicate with the Python LLM Backend. It runs on `http://localhost:3001`.
3.  **Frontend (`frontend/`):** A web-based user interface built with Vite and React. It provides the interactive elements for users to engage with the Emotional AI. It runs on `http://localhost:8080`.

## How to Run the Application

To get the application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.10 or higher:** Required for the Python LLM Backend.
*   **Node.js (LTS version) and npm:** Required for the Node.js API Backend and the Frontend.
*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.

### Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/veeda241/NOVA-.git
    cd NOVA-
    ```

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the Python LLM backend directory and install the required packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r emotional_ai_llm_web/emotional_ai_llm/requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js API Backend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the Node.js API backend directory and install the required packages.
    ```bash
    npm install --prefix api
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages.
    ```bash
    npm install --prefix frontend
    ```

### Starting the Services

There is a PowerShell script `start_all_services.ps1` provided to conveniently start all three services in the background.

1.  **Run the PowerShell Script:**
    Open PowerShell as an administrator and execute the script from the root directory of the project:
    ```powershell
    .\start_all_services.ps1
    ```
    This script will:
    *   Stop any existing processes on ports 3001 and 5000.
    *   Start the Python LLM Backend on `http://localhost:5000`.
    *   Start the Node.js API Backend on `http://localhost:3001`.
    *   Start the Frontend (Vite) on `http://localhost:8080`.
    *   Redirect logs to temporary files in `C:\Users\Vyas S\.gemini\tmp\d7198bdd68bb958056d766e907e0d0e9215d79c7241608f69301d4e06c94ca1a`.

### Accessing the Application

Once all services are started, you can access the frontend in your web browser:

*   **Frontend:** `http://localhost:8080`

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues like `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` after starting the services:

1.  **Verify Service Status:** Check the log files generated by `start_all_services.ps1` in the temporary directory mentioned above (e.g., `llm_error.log`, `api_error.log`, `frontend_error.log`) for any specific errors.
2.  **Clear Browser Cache:** Your browser might be caching old information. Clear its cache and cookies, or try an incognito window.
3.  **Firewall Settings:** Ensure that your firewall is not blocking access to ports `3001`, `5000`, and `8080`.
4.  **Manually Start Services (if needed):** If the PowerShell script doesn't work as expected, you can try starting each service individually:
    *   **Python LLM Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd emotional_ai_llm_web
        python app.py
        ```
    *   **Node.js API Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd api
        npm start
        ```
    *   **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm run dev
        ```
